                        <p>
                            I am a Full Stack Developer with ~20 years of development experience. I currently specialise in Laravel coupled primarily with Vue on the frontend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have 30+ years IT experience in total (25 commercial) having started at the early age of 9 as your typical nerd doing what he can to get games to work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my career thus far, I have done everything from building computers/servers/clusters from bare metal and managing them, designing and constructing networks(to WAN level) and for the last 20 years, full stack online development utilizing cutting-edge backend/frontend frameworks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was a partner and IT Director of a digital agency for 10 years and have an good understanding of client interaction from initial strategy to managing development and delivery, having said this my preference is development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a deep understanding of the internet, it's core components and how everything hangs together. I have witnessed the Internet's evolution from the early ‘90s and as a result, I am able to select technologies and strategies that match the client’s needs and help maximize the project's probability of success.
                            I pride myself on avoiding fads and ensuring that the correct strategy is selected, utilising the right tools that fit both the budget and fulfil the requirement.
                            I am a fan of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank" class="link-fx text-warning">The Lean Startup</a> methodology and strongly believe in small iterations to gauge feasibility as well as helping manage client expectations and budgets. I am also a huge fan of Basecamp's <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework" target="_blank" class="link-fx text-warning">Rework</a> principles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found your advert very appealing as I feel very strongly about work-life balance. Balance was the driving force behind leaving the agency when my son was born, I believe well rested and happy developers are the most focused, productive and creative. I love to collaborate and share knowledge and believe in finding wonder in whatever you do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a native English speaker living in Cape Town (South Africa) UTC+2.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please feel free to review my <router-link to="/resume" class="link-fx text-warning">resume</router-link> which is part of this simple SPA and contains more detail on my employment history and skill set. Most of my recent code is closed source, so I developed this resume as an example of a Lavavel/Vue app. It’s deployed live to a Digitalocean server via Forge. If you would like to review the source code, please send me an email address that I can add to the collaborators of this project.
