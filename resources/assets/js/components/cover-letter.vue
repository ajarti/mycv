                            Having been a partner and IT Director of a digital agency for 10 years, I have a good understanding of client service from initial strategy to managing development and delivery of the project.

                            Having witnessed the Internet's evolution from the early ‘90s, I have a deep understanding of the internet and it's core components. I am able to select technologies and strategies that match the client’s needs and help to maximize the project's probability of success.
                            I pride myself on avoiding fads and ensuring that the correct strategy is selected, utilising the right tools that fit both the budget and fulfil the requirements.
